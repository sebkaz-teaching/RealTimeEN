# why Apache Spark

Apache Spark has been reported as one of the _most valuable_ tech skills to learn by indeed.com.

Demand for Spark, Python and Big data hes exploded exponentially over the last decade.



## MLOps

Model creation should be **scalable**, **collaborative** and **reproducible**.
The principles, tools and techniques that make models scalable, collaborative and reproducible are known as **MLOps**.

# Apache Kafka for Stream

## Timestamps

Timestamp derive the behavior of Kafka Streams. 
Timestamps are a critical component of Kafka. The Kafka message format has a dedicated **timestamp** field.

You can set timestamp by Producer or it could be set by brocker.

### Time event
1. A _Producer_ (including Kafka Streams library) automatically sets this timestamp field if user does not. 
- This is current time of Producer environment whet the event is created.
2. A _Broker_ (Apache Kafka Server) - set processing timestamp or ingestion-time. 

### Time concept
- Time moves forward in Kafka by these timestamps
- For windowing operations this means the timestamps govern the opening and closing of windows
- Howl long a window remains open depends on timestamps only! 
- Kafka Stream has concept of **Stream time**

### Stream Time

- Largest timestamps seen so far
- Only moves forward, never backward
- if an out-of-order event arrives, stream-time stays where it is 

Event with _event-time_ < _stream-time_ are considered as **Out-of-order**
- For windowed operations, this means the event-timestamps is less than the current stream-time, but within the window time. 
- Out-of-order records are accepted and processed

**Late input** 
- The grace period, a per-window setting, defines a cut-off for out-of-order events. 
- Any out-of-order events that arrive after the grace period are considered (**too**) **late**, and thus are ignored and not processed.
- The delay of an event is determined by stream-time - event-timestamp
